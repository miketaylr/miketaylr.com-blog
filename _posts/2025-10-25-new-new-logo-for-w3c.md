title:  A new, new logo for the W3C

In an effort to pivot this site into a full on graphic design side business after 2 blog posts about logos in a row (hit me up exclusivly on [FB](https://fishbrain.com/anglers/miketaylr) to request a consultation), I thought I would reveal my new, new logo for the W3C.

It turns out they recently launched a new one, but [some folks don't love it](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2025Oct/thread.html). As an artist, it's not my job to critique other art, but instead to offer my own compelling vision for the web.

I shouldn't have to explain why I went with the classic dark blue and asparagus colors&mdash;that much is obvious. And of course, turning c into a file extension as a reminder that NCSA Mosaic was written in C (I didn't go with [WorldWideWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb) because that was written in Objective C and `.m` kinda messes it all up).
